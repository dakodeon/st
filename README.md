## Patches

Here are the patches applied in order of precedence:

- scrollback
- scrollback-mouse
- xresources
- vertcenter
- alpha
- selectioncolors
- selectionbg-alpha
- keyboard_select
- boxdraw
- externalpipe

For the external pipe functions I used modified versions of Luke Smith's scripts st-urlhandler and st-copyout. These should be copied over somewhere to the $PATH.
