* LUKEBASS ST BUILD

This is my new build for ST, based on version 0.8.5.
It was initially build on [2022-07-22], and brought to the state of my
previous build.

The =gitignore= file includes the =orig= and =rej= files created by the
=patch= command, also all the binaries. It also includes the =patches=
directory, which includes all the downloaded patches.

** APPLIED PATCHES

*** 1. Scrollback patch

Allows scrolling back on the terminal content, using Shift+PgUp/PgDown

*** 2. Scrollback-mouse patch

Allows scrolling back using the mouse scroll. Uses Shift+scroll.

*** 3. Scrollback-altscreen patch

Integrates scrolling with programs like man and less. Negates the necessity
of using Shift to scroll terminal content using the mouse.

*** 4. Xresources patch

Use colors and fonts defined in the =Xresouces= file

*** 5. Vertcenter patch

Centers the font in the line height, in case a larger line height is defined.

*** 6. Alpha patch

Adds an option to have transparent background with non-transparent
foreground elements.

*** 7. Selection colors patch

Adds two colors (selectionbg and selectionfg) for selections.

*** 8. Selectionbg alpha patch

Transparent selection background.

*** 9. Keyboard select patch

Use vim-like motions to select text on the terminal screen. Use
Ctrl+Shift+Escape to enter MOVE mode, use (some) vim bindings to move
around, use 's' to enter select mode, '/' or '?' to search for text, Escape
to exit discarding selection and Enter to exit keeping selection.

*** 10. Boxdraw patch

Fixes how boxes are displayed.

There was some buggy behaviour messing with the selection
colors/selectionbg alpha patches. This was due to some overlapping
attributes in =st.h=. Fixed it.

*** 11. External pipe patch

This patch allows to pipe the screen of st to external applications. Use
cases: Visit some URL that appears in the screen, copy the output of a
command.

I use two scripts (from LukeSmith), =st-urlhandler= and =st-copyout=, which
should be placed somewhere in the path.

Then, I had to manually add the lines that define the commands and the
keybindings:

#+begin_src C
static char *openurlcmd[] = { "/bin/sh", "-c", "st-urlhandler", "externalpipe", NULL };
static char *copyurlcmd[] = { "/bin/sh", "-c", "st-urlhandler -c", "externalpipe", NULL };
static char *copyoutput[] = { "/bin/sh", "-c", "st-copyout", "externalpipe", NULL };
#+end_src

and also:

#+begin_src C
static Shortcut shortcuts[] = {
  /* mask                 keysym          function        argument */
  /* ... other bindings ... */
  { TERMMOD,              XK_L,		externalpipe, 	{.v = openurlcmd} },
  { TERMMOD,              XK_Y,		externalpipe, 	{.v = copyurlcmd} },
  { TERMMOD,              XK_X,		externalpipe, 	{.v = copyoutput} },
};
#+end_src

So, Ctrl+Shift+l to visit a URL, Ctrl+Shift+y to copy a URL and
Ctrl+Shift+x to copy command output.

The scripts used are kept in the folder =externalpipe_scripts=. We can link
them somewhere in the path. /--NOTE: In my case I had to use hardlinks
because the target directory is part of my =dotfiles= repo, and is
soft-linked to my system./

** ORIGINAL README

st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install
